### UITableView with pull to refresh (i.e. bottom refresh)

--

This is an demonstration of a simplistic "pull up to refresh" approach whereby when you hit the end of the table view, it loads more data. This uses the last row in the table view as an animated "loading". This is discussed in [this StackOverflow discussion](http://stackoverflow.com/a/14919251/1271826).

This is for illustrative purposes only.

Developed in Xcode 6.3 for iOS 8.3. This basic idea should be compatible with earlier iOS versions, too.
